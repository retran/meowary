# Recurring Events

When creating a new daily note, automatically populate the **Events & Appointments** section with the events scheduled for that day of the week.

## Weekly

| Event | Days | Time |
|-------|------|------|

## Biweekly

| Event | Day | Time | Anchor Date |
|-------|-----|------|-------------|

*Anchor Date = the date of the most recent occurrence. Use it to calculate whether the event falls on a given week: if the Monday of the target week is an even number of weeks from the anchor date, include the event (0, 2, 4, ... weeks from anchor = include).*
