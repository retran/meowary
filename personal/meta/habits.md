# Habits

Define habits to track in daily notes. The agent reads this file when creating a new daily note and populates the **Habits** scorecard table.

## Good Habits (do)

Habits you want to build. Tracked as Yes/No — "Yes" means you did it today.

| Habit | Days | Notes |
| ----- | ---- | ----- |

## Bad Habits (avoid)

Habits you want to break. Tracked as Yes/No — "Yes" means you slipped today.

| Habit | Days | Notes |
| ----- | ---- | ----- |

**Days** column: which days the habit applies. Use `Daily` for every day, or list specific days (e.g. `Mon, Wed, Fri`). Leave empty for daily.

**Notes** column: optional context (e.g. "at least 30 min", "no screens after 10 PM").
