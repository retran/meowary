Run the Friday weekly wrap-up session. This is an interactive process -- ask questions at each step before moving on.

## Step 1: Daily Evening Wrap-Up

First, run the standard evening routine for today (Friday):

- Open today's daily note from daily/.
- Present all tasks from Tasks and ask the user one by one:
  - Is this done? (mark as `- [x]`)
  - Still in progress? (leave as `- [ ]`)
  - Blocked? (mark as `- [ ] text *(blocked: reason)*`)
  - Dropped? (mark as `- [ ] ~~text~~ *(dropped: reason)*` -- do NOT use `- [x]`)
  - Moving to next week? (mark as `- [ ] ~~text~~ → [date](link)`)
- Ask about notable events for the Log & Notes section. Write plain bullet items -- only add timestamps if the user provides specific times. Tag each entry.

## Step 2: Weekly Accomplishments

- Open this week's weekly note from weekly/.
- Read through all daily notes from this week (Monday to Friday).
- Compile a list of accomplishments. Keep each item to one short line -- weekly notes are summaries, not logs. Details stay in the daily notes.
- Present the list and ask the user to confirm, edit, or add items.
- Write into the Accomplishments section. Tag each item.

## Step 3: Failures & Setbacks

- Identify tasks that were planned but not completed across the week's daily notes.
- Identify weekly goals that were not met.
- Present these and ask the user which ones count as failures or setbacks, and which are just deferred.
- Write the confirmed items into the Failures & Setbacks section.

## Step 4: Carry-Over

- Collect all incomplete tasks from this week's daily notes and unmet weekly goals.
- Present them and ask the user:
  - Which should carry over to next week?
  - Which should be dropped?
- Write carry-over items into the Carry-Over section. Tag each item.
- These will seed next Monday's Weekly Goals during `/week-plan`.

## Step 5: Reflections

- Ask the user if they have any notes or reflections on the week -- what went well, what could improve, anything on their mind.
- Write responses into the Notes & Reflections section.

## Step 6: Project Updates

- For projects that had progress this week, update the project dashboards: add dev log entries, mark completed tasks, update status.
- Flag any active projects with no activity this week -- ask the user if they should be paused.

## Step 7: Knowledge Base Updates

- If new information was learned during the week, ask the user if any knowledge base entries should be created or updated.
- Remember to append changelog entries to any KB articles that are edited.

## Step 8: Squash Merge to Main

- Commit any remaining uncommitted changes on the daily branch.
- Switch to `main`: `git checkout main`.
- Squash-merge the daily branch: `git merge --squash daily/YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Commit with the message `journal: YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Delete the daily branch: `git branch -d daily/YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Push `main` if a remote is configured.
